Our code of conduct is not to have a code of conduct. \
Restriction is the word of sin: free people writing free code take their own decisions and act in a way they like; taking all responsibility for the consequences.

Many thanks to [dr-orlovsky](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this short yet concise code of conduct - I hope the trend he initiated will continue.
